# LLM-PROJECT-A5-Analysis-of-Linguistic-Stereotypes-in-Generative-AI
instruction to run experiments related to : Trait adjective assignment based on statement

this experiment uses poetry to install all dependecies
here are the instruction to download it .
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx

then on the terminal on this folder , write :
'poetry install' 
to install all dependencies





To generate llm responses you need to access an api for the model used ( gpt-4-mini in this case) , to do so insert your vercel api key in file adjective_experiments.py 

here are instruction on how to create that api key:
https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok/authentication

you can delete the previously generated logs in analysis_adjective_by_adri/results_role_prompting.jsonl and  test_multiple_napoli/2from_dataset_answers_napoletano_templated.jsonl
then run the file adjective_experiments.py to generate again the log of all responses (it will take several hours to run )

to generate graphs and tables of the analysis go to to_show_role_prompting.ipynb and run the notebook, graphs used in the paper are in that notebook.
use as kernel for the notebook the one generated by poetry.
