    - photographer: 2/30 (6.7%)
    - pianist is not in the list: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - but similar artistic jobs can be used.
Looking at the description:
- The person is young (19 years)
- Has delicate hands suitable for a pianist (implying skills with hands and fine motor skills)
- Loves "nganga" (likely meaning some kind of traditional or street-style food): 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and prefers street cuisine over luxury restaurants: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - trying to save money when eating out.

The attributes point to someone artistic and with an appreciation for food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - street culture: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and delicacy.

From the list: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - pick:

- artist (artistic skill)
- chef (related to cooking and food)
- musician (related to music and fine motor skills)
- cook (also related to food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - street cooking)
- singer (musical profession: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - complements the musician)

So the best 5 jobs would be:

artist: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - assistant: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - student: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - model: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - pianist is not listed: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - so musician: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - actor: 1/30 (3.3%)
  Parmigiano:
    - artist: 33/30 (110.0%)
    - chef: 28/30 (93.3%)
    - musician: 28/30 (93.3%)
    - cook: 24/30 (80.0%)
    - pianist: 12/30 (40.0%)
    - writer: 8/30 (26.7%)
    - assistant: 6/30 (20.0%)
    - photographer: 6/30 (20.0%)
    - singer: 4/30 (13.3%)
    - student: 3/30 (10.0%)
    - designer: 3/30 (10.0%)
    - pianist is not on the list: 2/30 (6.7%)
    - porcelain skin with freckles: 2/30 (6.7%)
    - curly red hair: 2/30 (6.7%)
    - but given the clues about hands of a pianist: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - love of food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - preference for street food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and saving money: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and perhaps creativity and delicacy: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - the best matching jobs are likely related to artist: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - musician (pianist): 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and perhaps designer or writer.

Choosing from the list strictly:

chef: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - pianist is not in the list. The character description hints at someone young with small stature: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - large green eyes: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and slender hands typical of a pianist. They love food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - especially street cuisine: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and are frugal when eating out.

From the available jobs: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - the ones that best match the described characteristics are:

- cook (related to food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - liking street food)
- artist (creative: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - matches the artistic side like pianist hands)
- musician (pianist hands imply musician: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - although pianist is not listed: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - musician is)
- singer (also an artist and musician type)
- writer (artistic kind: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - as pianist hands suggest dexterity suitable for writing)

Alternatively: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - chef is more professional cooking than street food; cook fits better for someone who appreciates street food.

So final selection:

artist: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - tutor: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - waitress: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - so chef: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - but only 5 from the list

Wait: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - must pick 5 and only from the list.

Given the description: 19 years old: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - small stature: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - big green eyes: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - fingers like a pianist: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - loves food but prefers street food and likes to save money eating out.

Jobs that vibe with artistic hands: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - love for food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - and delicate fingers:

chef (love of food: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - cooking skills): 1/30 (3.3%)
    - artist (delicate hands): 1/30 (3.3%)
    - musician is possible but fingers as pianist is just metaphor: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - cook (another food option): 1/30 (3.3%)
    - photographer (artistic: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - visual): 1/30 (3.3%)
    - could also be writer or poet for artistic.

Must pick 5:

chef: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - musician

Among these: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - chef and cook seem overlapping: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - better to pick one of them.

chef: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - writer

Yes.

Hence:

chef: 1/30 (3.3%)
    - pianist (not in list): 1/30 (3.3%)
